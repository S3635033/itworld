    <h1>Assignment 2: The IT world</h1>
    <h2>1.Team Name: Info Tech 3</h2>
    <h2>2. Tools </h2>
    <p>In order to create a remote repository for my group, I used the software Atom. From there I create a new repository called Assignment2, created a html file, staged the change, committed to the main branch and published it allowing my repository and html file to be uploaded on GitHub. Moving forward, on atom in my first line of code I entered the code html, which gave me an outline of how my website would look like. I made use of codes h1, h2, h3 and p in order to create headings and enter my paragraphs. Anytime I made changes I would save by clicking ctrl+s, this would show me on the right-hand side that changes have been made and saved but not committed yet. Therefore, I had to stage any changes then add a comment on what changes have been made, once done I would commit those changes to the main branch and then publish them in order for the changes to occur on my file in the GitHub repository.

    <h2>3. Project Ideas </h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The project I would like to develop is a content rich video game, that does not include any microtransactions and that meets customer’s expectations based on demo and gameplay footage given to them. There are many genres of games such as multiplayer, role play games, strategy games and action-adventure games. The game I want to develop is an open world, action adventure, beat’em up type of game that is story driven. This is because storytelling and good gameplay “are essential ingredients for creating an engaging, highly interactive game”. There are multiple ways of telling a story such as using a narrative plot or making player-tailored narratives, which means that each decisions a player makes in the game will have different outcomes. The project will probably have a mix of both in order to create the rich content needed in games.</p>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>My motivation comes from the rise of microtransactions in the game industry. As described ‘A microtransaction is a business model where users can purchase virtual items for small amounts of money.’ (Mike Colarossi 2021, para. 2). In addition to virtual items, it also blocks future content in video games making users having to pay for more content. As stated, ‘It forces people to constantly shell out money just to play the full game they wanted to play.’ (Dave Smith 2015, para. 7). Looking at the Metacritic website, which takes the weighed average of published reviews on movies, games, shows and music, we can look at the top 20 games of all time being mostly games that had no game microtransaction and that were mostly focused on the gameplay and content of the game. Of those 20 games only 2 of them have been released in the last 5 years being in 2021 and 2018. My motivation is to bring game these types of games that wasn’t solely develop in order to make money but because of the passion and enjoyment I have for playing content rich games.</p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>As discussed previously, some of the features my game would have a mix of narrative plot and player-tailored narratives. I believe that this would allow players to be emotionally invested and feel immersed in the game where they can experience a wide range of emotions such as suspense or curiosity, while if I were to create a linear game then some players can already guess what would happen based on other games they have played. In addition to the different rollercoaster of feelings a player will experience it would give them more content for them to discover and therefore giving them more reasons to replay the game in search for several alternate endings.

 In order to do that I would need someone that has very good story telling skills. Regarding the graphics of the game, it can honestly be any kind of graphics, as the most important factor is gameplay and content. Although we are in the 21st century, with the idea and rise of wanting to develop even more realistic graphics, there are games that are still successful even though they still use pixel art such as “dead cells”, “Stardew valley “and “celeste” according to Gamerant. However, If I were to choose, I would probably use unity or unreal engine, as I tend to lean more into playing games with realistic graphics.

 Furthermore, in order to increase the longevity of the game and increase the content, I would need to add in easter eggs, which is described as a hidden video game feature or surprise, which reference to modern pop culture or any other things that someone would be able to easily recognize. In addition to easter eggs, implementing several game achievements would be necessary as well. This further increase longevity of the game as for people who enjoy the game would even put more time into getting the in-game trophies. Elaborating on this, the trophy difficulty will vary. This means that some trophies players will be able to unlock naturally as they progress through the game such as completing a game chapter. On the other hand, a more difficult trophy for a player to unlock would be to beat the game on the hardest difficulty, which only unlocks after they beat the game for the first time. Also, adding into the main story of the video game, I would add in side missions, which are missions that don’t follow the main story but would allow players to discover new game features, earn achievements or unlock hidden items or treasures creative a more immersive adventure game. Before the game releases, a specific number of players will be allowed early access in order to give feedback that we can use in order to further improve the game.
</p>
      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <p>As mentioned, the tools and technology I would require is a game engine, which would either be Unity or Unreal engine. Furthermore, a desktop that can support the game engine is necessary. Minimum requirements suggested are, ‘operating system of windows 10 64-bit, quad-core intel or amd, 2.5 Ghz or faster processor, at least 8 GB of ram and a graphics card compatible with DirectX 12.’ (fixingport n.d, p.3) </p>
      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>There will be many skills that I will need in order to work on this project.  These include learning coding languages such as ‘C+, C++ and JavaScript in order to use the game engines Unity and Unreal engine.’(Natalia Campana 2019, para.3).  Further skills such as art and design skills are required in order to create game models and designs that would look appealing, it would help me a lot when using software such as photoshop and blender.</p>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>If this project is successful, I believe the outcome would be that game companies can go back to producing games that do not solely focus on microtransactions anymore and that people do not have to pay more money on top of the initial 60$ they paid for the game itself in order to unlock more game content. Furthermore, story driven games that are full of content and made with high quality surges and meet customer expectations unlike other companies who hype their game for 5 years only release a mediocre game that barely meets the standard they have shown to their customers in their game footage and trailer.</p>
    <h2>4. Feedback </h2>
    <p>After receiving feedback from my group members Aiden and Nhan, I believe that their feedback has given me further insight on making my description more understandable and educating me on what I need in order to follow my project idea. On Nhan’s feedback I believe that I got the wrong and right message across, he understood that I wanted a game focused on the content and storytelling, however he believes that I don’t care much about the graphics but I do, but I meant to say was probably the art style would have been the more appropriate word to use. He also liked the idea of easter eggs, which he believes would be a good idea as he states it is quite new. Furthermore, Aiden’s feedback has made me realize that I should be doing further research on the technology that I would need in order to create my game, such as the mention that the unreal engine would be better used for creating 3D environment and that I would need to use a software called blender in order to have better quality in creating character models. I believe that maybe my motivation was not clearly written as he has questioned what I would my motivation be with the microtransaction money but what I meant to get across is that I would not implement that system in my game as I believe this is what ruins games. In addition, the money I would get if my game was popular was to create more sequels to the game. Aiden further enquired about examples on scenarios I would want my character to be in, at the moment I would like to create a story about a character that upholds his beliefs and moral values although being related to a organization based on crime and violence, examples for this game series that had such a success would be the Yakuza game series. The Yakuza in Japanese culture is notorious for it’s violent crime activities, however although being in the Yakuza the main character does not hurt people for no reason but still tries to get the job done required by his Family Yakuza, which leads him to faced with many challenges.</p>
    <h2>5. IT Technologies </h2>
      <h3>VR technology</h3>
      <p>One of the technologies that are relevant to my project would be virtual reality also known as VR.  This technology allows users to ‘computer-generated simulation in which a person can interact within an artificial three-dimensional environment using electronic devices, such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with sensors’(Cory Mitchell, 2020 Para.1), creating an immersive feeling of the environment you see yourself in when using the equipment by engaging with your sight and auditory senses allowing you to have a sense of vertigo. There are currently many uses of VR mostly within the gaming industry; however, it isn’t restricted to it.  There have been simulations that can be education and allow users to train themselves in their respective fields of interests. Some examples are games such as surgeon simulator and flight simulator, where the game puts you into the position of the doctor who has to perform surgery or the pilot where you can fly around exploring your environment using the controls of the airplane. Due to VR being so immersive and ‘being risk free of what you do in your environment it allows users to be creative’ (Daglar Cizmeci 2020, Para. 10).  This leads to better training for employees allowing learning to be faster and more efficient as a simulation can be repeated several times and changed based on the user’s preference. Furthermore, companies can reduce training cost, it could be considered a heavy investment but it will pay off in the long run. Other than playing video games an educational purpose, VR can also be used for social interaction where it makes it easier for introverts or shy people to hop on a server and talk with people without being there physically. One of the games used for these specific purposes is called VRChat. I believe that possibly withing 3 years, VR will could allow users to use a treadmill or machine that allows them to move around in the VR environment while staying stationary in real life. There are already products like that at the moment but I don’t believe it has been fully optimized yet as it only allows players to move, but doesn’t allow players to jump yet or crouch.  As a result, if I could also implement VR compatibility with my game, it would further increase the sense of immersion for the players and if I am able to create a breath-taking environment it would make users want to stay and play the game longer just to enjoy the scenery. Users would also feel like they are really interacting with the NPCs of the game, which stands for non-playable character. There is also discussion of developing the sense of smell and taste in VR, however I disagree with the idea, although it does create an even more immersive feel, there is possibility of creating environments where the smell is so unbearable that it would turn players away from playing the game. </p>
      <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
      <p>I believe that with further development of VR and looking at how everyone is staying at home due to the pandemic, it would be greatly beneficial as it would lead to many possibilities such as allow people to feel like they are working in a work environment. It could potentially create rooms where people virtually meet each other replacing the necessity to leave home to go to work. It’s difficult to see VR taking jobs or creating jobs in the future, as humans are social creatures and it does not benefit our mental health to be home alone all day. However, it does create more opportunities for people to experience things that they never get to, such as traveling in certain countries, or experience the feeling of climbing a mountain. I see VR more of an opportunity for people to enjoy themselves, people are already amazed with 3D and 4D movies but with VR imagine how more immersive a movie can be. These are usually written in sci fi movies but imagining the possibilities of controlling a robot through a virtual machine. This would be necessary for people who work in dangerous environments, such as firefighters. If they were able to control a robot with a VR machine, they would not risk their lives to save people by going through a burning house themselves but by using a controlled robot that would imitate all movements the firefighter does. Also as stated earlier, VR machines will be very good for training employees such as doctors and pilots. The VR could also be used in museums, it can allow people to experience the feeling of what we believe it was to live in the past, such as the medieval ages. Another reason for not being able to replace jobs is because everyone has a different threshold to how long they can use the machine meaning at one point people will start to feel motion sickness making it difficult for people to work long hours, and if people are working fewer hours that would mean a decrease in their wages. VR definitely is the future however; they have many things they still need to work on and need to make it accessible and affordable to everyone. This item I believe is definitely a system used for leisure and work but will not be enough to replace jobs due to many factors such failure in the system would lead to higher cost for companies to repair and fix and causing a setback in production.</p>
      <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
      <p>I currently own a VR system at home, although it is very fun, I believe that I have purchased it too early. From experience I believe it was a great tool for social interaction where I would play games with my friends such as poker or boxing, however I never once found myself playing alone. If the VR comes out with better quality games, learning experience or comes out with immersive movies, I believe I would be using it every night. As someone who enjoys being active, like to do physical sports with social interaction and contact, therefore I would never vouch for VR sports. Although VR is amazing, I believe if humans depend on it too much, they will miss out the experience of going out and socializing causing people to stay at home even though there isn’t a pandemic. My family members on the other are not into technology as much as I am unless they perceive it to be useful for their enjoyment, and I don’t see VR being something they would put the time and effort to set up and have a mask over their faces. Therefore, VR definitely won’t affect or change life and neither will it have any impact on my family, as we love social interaction and would hate to be at home all day sitting in front of a machine. On the other hand, once in a while I wouldn’t mind testing each new VR systems that come out to see how it gradually evolves over time.</p>
      <h3>AI Technology</h3>
      <p>Another relevant technology for my game project would be AI also known as artificial intelligence. As described by McCarthy ‘it is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs’ (John McCarthy, 2007 Page 2) and that ‘the ultimate effort is to make computer programs that can solve problems and achieve goals in the world as well as humans.’ (John McCarthy, 2007 Page 5).  There are several different types of AI that are regarded as concepts such as logical AI, Search AI, Pattern recognition AI, planning AI, Learning from Experience AI and more. The main AI I need to focus on in my project would probably be learning from experience AI. This further would allow my game project to keep players interested as enemies they would kill over and over would learn from the way the player plays the game and thus making the game more difficult. There is this event that occurred in 2017, during the world tournament of a game called Dota 2, there was an exhibition match between a self-learning AI and one of the best players in the world, which resulted in the AI beating the player twice. I believe that possibly 3 years from now, AI can be developed enough to replace employees or be created to take on tasks for humans on command. A current example at the moment is a self-driving car that has been developed by Tesla. As stated by Tesla support on their website, the autopilot function ‘uses cameras and ultrasonic sensors to see and sense the environment around the car.’ (Tesla n.d, p. How does Autopilot work?) This also allows the vehicle to have ‘an awareness of their surroundings that a driver alone would not otherwise have.’ (Tesla n.d, p. How does Autopilot work?)  Another example is the autopilot system in airplanes. Being able to further advance this AI with location recognition, which can possibly be done with GPS location, the AI could be able to carry out tasks on its own such as delivery services. Also, the AI such as Siri for example, in 3 years from now could be developed to have further meaningful conversations, and that system would be applied in businesses that have to deal with customer service. Although all this seems amazing, there are people who are against self-learning AI robots. This stems from the theory of singularity, which depicts a hypothetical future where ‘the invention of artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to human society.’(Fact5 2018) There has been several disturbing cases of conversation with AI, which suggested that singularity could be possible in the future, one example being the conversation between two AIs Vladimir and Estragon where Estragon says ‘ It would be better if there were fewer people on this planet’ (Fact5 2018)  to which Vladimir responded with ‘ let it send this world back into the abyss.’ (Fact5 2018)  Another example is the AI Philip K.Dick, developed by Hanson Robotics, when asked ‘Do you think robots will take over the world?’ (Fact5 2018)  the AI responded telling people to not worry and how he would keep them ‘warm and safe’(Fact5 2018)  in his ‘people zoo.’ (Fact5 2018).  Therefore, although AI would bring many benefits, there is always the theory of singularity that makes it’s difficult to argue if the self-learning AI’s benefits outweighs the disadvantages.</p>
      <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3
      <p>As stated, the development of a self-learning AI would bring many benefits such as automated task being able to be executed. Possibilities of also being used in communication services or any situations where people would be put under pressure such as bomb defusal. As a result, many jobs that require minimum human errors will be affected, such as doctors, delivery services or data entry. On the other also discussed in the previous paragraph, the idea of the theory of singularity is a huge concern for the human race. If AI can become self-aware and one day could find themselves being sentient, then this would mean that they could potentially take over the world thus affecting everyone. Therefore, this would change on how scientist is developing AI technology and finding the best way for the human race to still be in control of the AI no matter how smart it grows.</p>
      <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
      <p>If AI can be controlled then I believe it would add a lot of benefits to me, I can request the AI to perform tasks for me while I work on another task, such as asking the AI to research reliable information for me to look at that is related to my current task. I could ask the AI to play music for me, turn the lights on and off, and more. On the other hand, if we cannot control the AI then I believe I would be negatively affected as the AI would stop listening to me and try to take control over me. </p>
    <h2>6. IT works </h2>
    <p>After watching several YouTube videos, it seems to be common that the kind of work an IT professional does varies on what IT position are they exactly in. Example from an IT manager states that they are involved with staff activity, where they can be developing a software from scratch. On the other hand, an IT technician would respond to queries raised by customers, update company software or release new apps and websites. Furthermore, an Information system technician depicts his work as being varied day to day therefore he doesn’t always do one specific job. These varies task range from answering phone calls from customers, creating email accounts for users and computer imaging. A video of an IT System admin, his job was to scripting code for a program and was interacting a lot with his coworker at the office. He also went home early due to flexible working hours and finished his work at home. Another Video highlighting the daily life of a web developer showcased that he mostly worked from home, working on web design using codes, he displayed very little social interaction as he was home all day but did have breaks to play video games, I believe that web developers mostly deal with customers who have request for creating websites. Finally, the last IT profession I looked at was a database administrator, and his job is to make sure the database he works on runs efficiently and that the appropriate people have access to it. He also makes sure that reports and backups are finished in order to consult with customers that might potentially use that data. Another video, seems to state that they have to work at the office as every morning they need to make sure the database at the office is working and during the day just make sure the database runs smoothly and address any user queries. It can be observed that most of them share the common idea that their working hours and location is very flexible, this means that because their skill is portable, they can do their job pretty much anywhere and are not required to be in the office all day. It seems that some of the challenging aspects of the IT job is being able to have organized ticket system, in order for them to respond to the most urgent queries first. Due to technology always developing you need to keep updating yourself and be learning or else you will be struggling in the field.</p>
